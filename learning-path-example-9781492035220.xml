  <description-short><div><p>With the growing popularity of microservices architecture, the exponential proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), and an increasing need for highly scalable applications, event-driven architecture (EDA) has become a very popular mechanism to support these technologies. EDA is a popular distributed asynchronous architecture model that is also highly adaptable and can be used for small applications as well as large, complex ones. At its core are highly decoupled, single-purpose event-processing components that asynchronously receive and process events.</p>
<p>In this learning path designed for intermediate- to advanced-level software architects and developers, you are first introduced to the broad concepts and principles of EDA. Next, you&#8217;ll look at specific implementation patterns and how you can apply them in your systems. You&#8217;ll then examine how to manage data consistency, and then finish up by learning how to get started building EDA at scale. By the end of this learning path, you&#8217;ll be ready to begin using event-driven principles and patterns in your own applications.</p>
<p><b>What you&#8217;ll learn&#8212;and how you can apply it</b></p>
<ul><li>How to use event-driven principles and patterns in your own systems</li><li>How to manage data consistency in EDAs</li><li>How to get started building event-driven architecture at scale</li></ul>
<p><b>This learning path is for you because&#8230;</b></p>
<ul><li>You're an experienced software architect or developer building medium- to large- scale enterprise applications, and you need to begin using event-driven principles and patterns for your solutions</li><li>You're tasked with creating a highly scalable system and want to see if EDA might be the optimal approach for your system</li></ul>
<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> None</p>
<p><b>Materials or downloads needed in advance:</b> None</p></div></description-short>
